<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋, I'm Jatin Unecha</h1>
<h3 align="center">Software Engineer</h3>

I am a Full Stack Software Engineer with a strong focus on backend development. My expertise lies in creating robust and scalable microservices and RESTful APIs. Although my primary strength is backend development, I have also worked extensively as a Full Stack Developer, gaining experience in a wide range of technologies. 

I hold an M.S. in Computer Science from San Jose State University and a B.S. in Computer Science from Pune Institute of Computer Technology. My professional journey includes roles at Rakuten Advertising, Zinnia, and BMC Software, where I have developed RESTful web services, led cross-functional teams, and created microservices and REST APIs.

I'm passionate about learning new skills and technologies, and I'm always eager to take on new challenges to grow as a developer.
